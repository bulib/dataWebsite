<p>Since 2011 the National Science Foundation (NSF) has required data management plans (DMPs) for incoming grant applications. This guide will help you understand the NSF’s data management requirements and help you write a useful, compliant data management plan. At first the inclusion of data management plans seemed more like another box to check off in the grant application process; however, data management plans are becoming increasingly important part of NSF grant applications and are being more throughly reviewed. To keep your application competative you’ll want a DMP that is as good as your research. </p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>You have 2 pages - and only 2 pages - to write your data management plan. Let’s review the sections your data management plan might require to adhere to NSF’s policy. </p>

<h3 id="types">Types</h3>

<p>The best way to start your data management plan is to think about the types of data you’ll be collecting. Reviewing your data types first will help ensure everyone is on the same page. It is okay to be detailed and specific when discussing your data types. If you know you’re using a piece of equipement or data collection methodology be sure to mention that. The policy states you should include: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The types of data researchers work with are as diverse as the researchers themselves and their research interests. Common data types include images, numerical data, experimental data, observational data, and text. A sample from <a href="https://dmptool.org/plans/11390.pdf">Kimberly Anderson’s DMP on “REU Site: A Multidisciplinary Research Experience in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devies”</a> starts: </p>

<p><code>
The data generated from this project will be of two types. Each REU student will generate experimental data specific to his/her research project related to Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices. In addition, both quantitative and qualitative data will be generated that assesses the outcomes of the REU program. 
</code></p>

<h3 id="data-and-metadata-standards">Data and Metadata Standards</h3>

<p>After you’ve figured out the data types, the next step is to think about the data and metadata standards you’ll be using. This section allows you to detail the specific file formats you’ll be using and why you’re using them. You’ll also want to think about the metadata your data will need.</p>

<p>What’s metadata? Metadata is the information about your data that another research or future collaborator will need to use your data. This can include, but is not limited to, who created the data, when it was created, and a persistent identifier - like a DOI (digital object indentifier) or URL (universal resource locator). Other likely metadata includes your naming convention documentation, variables, when the data was created or collected, and data analysis documentation. The policy states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is worth noting that if there are no common standards for your field you should document this as well as provide a potential solution. While metadata can be complex and take time to create, much of it can be automated to save time it is planned before the data is gathered. The best quote we’ve found about metadata comes from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/centralasian/?rb=1">cea+</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kZd-ZD5lru5a7jIbyi9q8cBYCCAKRnIBSRvixYFtoF0/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1#slide=id.gef38dfd1f_0_100">the Mozilla Science Lab</a>: </p>

<p><code>Metadata is a love note to the future.</code><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/33255628@N00/8071729256/">[1]</a></p>

<p>And for multi-year projects, it is important to remember that note to the future is likely to be to your future self. While creating metadata takes time, the efforts are normally rewarded «suggestion: sounds a bit awk to say ‘normally rewarded’» with not only clear project documentation but also increasing «suggestion: is ‘increasing’ the best word?» the reproducibility of your research. </p>

<h3 id="access-and-sharing">Access and Sharing</h3>

<p>One of the goals of a data management plan is to increase researchers’ ability to share their data and access other’s data. Ideally, this will help verify research results and help researchers build on the work of others. However, the NSF understands that not all data can be made available such as data on human research subjects, patented data, and data involving nationally sensitive projects. With that said, much of the research that NSF sponsors has data that can be shared with the public. From the policy you should include «suggestion: you say “policy” twice in same sentence, change one»: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section of your data management plan details the policies and ground rules you’ll have for sharing your data. Will your data be put in a data repository? Will their be an initial embargo on access to your data? If your data won’t be publicly available, are there ways you can make it available to others? If so, how will that be done? </p>

<p>As you think through the access and sharing part of your data management plan, you’ll likely also want to think «suggestion: change one of the ‘think’, redundant» about how others can reuse and redistribute your data. </p>

<h3 id="reuse-and-redistribution">Reuse and Redistribution</h3>

<p>In this part of your plan you’ll want to document how others can access your data and any restrictions on how the data is to be shared and/or reused. If you are placing restrictions, this is the place to describe why and how others can comply with them.</p>

<p>Your NSF data management plan should include: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives. «suggestion: maybe targeted audience would know this, but I’m not sure what “production of derivatives” mean»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NSF acknowledges that not all data can be made open and freely available. If you do need to place limits on the use of your data you’ll need to clearly document and justify them. </p>

<h3 id="archiving-and-preserving">Archiving and Preserving</h3>

<p>The last part of the data management plan is to describe the long-term usage for your data, which can be tricky for researchers who are used to thinking about their data within the life of a particular grant. In addition, you’re unlikely to have more funds for your data 5 years after your grant ends. The policy asks that you describe the </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best solution to archive and preserve your data is to partner with an exsiting service or institution. There are many data repositories and <a href="/dataWebsite/share/selecting-a-data-repository">selecting the right one</a> is important. Many fields have data repositories that are well known to researchers in that discipline, however, not everyone is so lucky. «suggestion: not sure if I would say ‘…not everyone is so lucky’, is there another way to phrase this?»</p>
